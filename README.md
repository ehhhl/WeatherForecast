# WeatherForecast
Android development

Through this project, I learned how to use Android Studio for project development, mastered the design and lifecycle management of Activities, and acquired the skills to fetch and parse JSON data via HTTP protocol. I also learned to display data in the app using multithreading technology and implemented complex list displays using custom adapters, handling and displaying weather data with icons. Additionally, by adding music player and schedule features, I enhanced the app's diversity and practicality, mastering the basic implementation methods of multimedia playback and schedule management.

In this project, I not only improved my user interaction design skills by creating a beautiful and user-friendly interface, but also provided personalized weather forecast services through city selection and location functions. I learned how to organize and manage Android projects, including code standards and documentation, and further improved my ability to analyze and solve problems by summarizing development experiences and issues through experiment reports.

Moreover, I fully considered the app's scalability, compatibility, and robustness during the development process, ensuring stable operation across different devices and environments. By using SQLite to store user data, I enhanced data management capabilities. In the process of implementing additional features and extended requirements, I continuously optimized the code and design, improving the app's functionality and user experience. These learnings and practices not only helped me master the basic skills of Android development but also enhanced my project management and problem-solving abilities, laying a solid foundation for future development work.
